# Privacy Policy for Event Countdown Pro

## Introduction
Event Countdown Pro is designed to be a private and secure tool for managing your personal countdowns. We value your privacy and aim to be transparent about our data practices.

## Information Collection
- **Personal Data:** We do not collect any personal data such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers.
- **Device Data:** The app does not access your contacts, location (unless explicitly requested for search features), or files.
- **Sensitive Permissions:** The app requests Microphone access only for the "AI Assistant" feature. Audio is processed in real-time by the Google Gemini API and is not stored by this application.

## Data Usage
- Your countdown data is stored locally on your device and is never uploaded to our servers.
- Integrated AI features use the Google Gemini API. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for how they handle transient data used for generative AI.

## Children’s Privacy
Our app is safe for all ages. We do not knowingly collect or solicit any information from children.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
